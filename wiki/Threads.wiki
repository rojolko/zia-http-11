#How to use the thread class in the Zia.

= Introduction =

Using Threads is simple. The only thing you need is to create a Handle, and an instance of the class thread. See details below.


= Details =

void function()
{
HANDLE h;
Thread *t = new Thread();

try
{
 h = t->tStart(functest);
}

catch(char say[])
{
  std::cout << "Exception :" << say << std::endl;
  std::cout << "Program Termination." << std::endl;
 }
}


Where functest is the startroutine of your newly created Thread. Ressource sharing is on the work and mutexs too.
